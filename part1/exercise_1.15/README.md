# Imgur downloader

This image can be executed with the following command `docker run -v "$(pwd):/mydir" mpajuka/imgur-download <imgur-url>`, where `<imgur-url>` is an optional (valid) imgur link, which the user wants to download. By default, without an argument, the command downloads a dog video to the current working directory.
